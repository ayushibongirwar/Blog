    <h1>Internet Insecurities</h1>

    Social Media is a very weird place if you look at it in a way i do And when i say "weird" i don't mean it in bad way of course it is one of the main reason why long distance relationships still work for some (lucky) people. But at the same time its reason for all the insecurities one can possibly feel about themselves.<br>
<p>What i have noticed is that even if by 1 click you can connect to hundreds of people online it still manages to isolate you from the real world. You sit on that couch forever scrolling through your instagram or twitter feed thinking that you are socialising but in reality its just you alone there with a device which is fooling your brain that you are surrounded by people.
well.. i did not write this blog to make you feel scared but we all know this is the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>When i think about what i really process after seeing those influencers over social media i  realised that more than getting motivated i rather feel low about myself in some way or another.</p>
<p>When i was discussing this with my friend once she complained about facing a troll online for having bigger forehead than the "usual" . now i don't know where are these standards about having a "usual" length of forehead but believe it or not she spent 30 mins of her life thinking about that comment and even after that it stuck with her.</p>
<p>What i really am trying to convey here is that Extra Exposure to things is harmful as well. Nobody wants to spend their time thinking about what is wrong about them or their life comparing it to materialistic but appealing show offs on social media rather than working on important things instead.</p>
<p>What you can really do is not vanish or ghost your online friends but know the difference. The difference between what's real and what is not. Setting timers to your apps or alarms to be with people who really matter can bring a lot of change. Taking time off internet to take care of yourself is something i do whenever it becomes overwhelming for me. Other than that you should always manage to have relations with people with whom you know meeting them personally is only way it can do justice to your bond. Having laughs that lasts longer than two texts are important. You should miss that feeling of uncontrollable pig snort laugh just cause the other one is still laughing and those eye contacts which are obviously more intense than emoticons or just enjoy your own thoughts and company for a while.</p>
<p>If you really didn't connect with what i tried to shed light here then my friend you are already blessed to not have had faced any of these till now. And i hope you stay that way but to those who did relate.. i know how these internet insecurities feel like and i hope you start doing better.ðŸ’•</p>
